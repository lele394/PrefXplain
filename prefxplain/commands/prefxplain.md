description: Generate or update an interactive dependency graph of the current codebase with natural-language descriptions for each file, rendered as a self-contained HTML the user can share. Use this skill whenever the user wants to understand, map, review, present, or explain the architecture of a codebase -- onboarding onto a new repo, preparing a walkthrough for a manager or teammate, pitching the code to an investor or client, or finding the core files vs the orphans. Trigger on indirect phrasings too: "help me understand this repo", "what's the structure here", "I need to present the code to X", "what are the load-bearing files", "draw me a map of this project", "update the diagram", "refresh prefxplain", "show the graph", "open prefxplain".

# prefxplain

Produces `prefxplain.html` -- an interactive, self-contained map of the codebase.
Nodes are files, edges are imports, and each node carries a 1-2 sentence
natural-language description written by you (the LLM running this skill).

**Smart re-runs**: if `prefxplain.json` already exists, descriptions, titles,
flowcharts, groups, and highlights from the previous run are preserved for
files that still exist. Only new or previously-undescribed files need work.
This makes re-running cheap. Exception: if `$LEVEL` changes between runs
(e.g. the user ran `/prefxplain newbie` yesterday and `/prefxplain expert` today),
descriptions are re-generated in the new voice.

## Bootstrap

Run these checks at the very start of every invocation:

**1. Check CLI availability:**

```bash
command -v prefxplain >/dev/null && prefxplain --version 2>/dev/null
```

If exit code != 0, tell the user:

> prefxplain is not installed on this machine. I can install it with:
> `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefOptimize/PrefXplain/main/install.sh | bash`
> OK? [y/N]

Wait for confirmation. If yes, run the curl|bash one-liner above.
Do NOT use `pip install prefxplain` — PyPI lags the GitHub main branch and
ships an older renderer. The installer clones fresh from main and sets up the
venv + shim + slash commands for you.

If the installer fails, stop and say what went wrong.

**2. Check IDE extension (for in-IDE preview):**

Check both the CLI AND the on-disk extension directories — common macOS setups
ship VS Code/Cursor but don't add the `code`/`cursor` CLI to PATH, so a pure-
CLI check yields false negatives.

```bash
# Resolve PREFXPLAIN_ROOT: prefer the curl|bash install at ~/.prefxplain,
# fall back to the installed-package location if someone vendored it via
# `pip install -e` from a checkout.
if [ -d "$HOME/.prefxplain/prefxplain-vscode" ]; then
  PREFXPLAIN_ROOT="$HOME/.prefxplain"
else
  PREFXPLAIN_ROOT="$(prefxplain --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && python3 -c "import prefxplain, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(prefxplain.__file__).parent.parent)" 2>/dev/null || echo "")"
fi
EXT_INSTALLED="no"
for ext_dir in "$HOME/.vscode/extensions" "$HOME/.cursor/extensions" "$HOME/.windsurf/extensions"; do
  if ls -d "$ext_dir"/prefxplain.prefxplain-vscode-* >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    EXT_INSTALLED="yes"
    break
  fi
done
# Fallback: CLI listing if on-disk check missed
if [ "$EXT_INSTALLED" = "no" ]; then
  IDE_CLI="$(which code 2>/dev/null || which cursor 2>/dev/null || which windsurf 2>/dev/null || echo "")"
  if [ -n "$IDE_CLI" ] && $IDE_CLI --list-extensions 2>/dev/null | grep -q "prefxplain.prefxplain-vscode"; then
    EXT_INSTALLED="yes"
  fi
fi
echo "EXT_INSTALLED: $EXT_INSTALLED"
```

If EXT_INSTALLED is "no" and `$PREFXPLAIN_ROOT` is set, install silently via
the Makefile target (it detects the IDE CLI and works even when none is on
PATH by falling back to the .app bundle):

```bash
[ -n "$PREFXPLAIN_ROOT" ] && cd "$PREFXPLAIN_ROOT" && make install-extension
```

If installation can't find any IDE, skip silently — preview will fall back
to the plain browser (step 6 prints both the `vscode://` deeplink and the
`http://` URL so the user can click whichever works).

## Division of labor

- **The package** (`prefxplain.analyzer`, `prefxplain.renderer`, `prefxplain.graph`)
  handles: filesystem walk, AST/regex parsing for Python, JS/TS, C/C++, Go, Rust,
  Java, and Kotlin, graph construction, metrics (in/out-degree, cycles), automatic
  layering by abstraction level, and HTML rendering. Exclusions are built into the
  walker: `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.git/`.

- **You** (the model executing this skill) handle: reading each file and writing a
  good description. This is the only LLM-dependent step, and because you run
  in-session, no API key is needed -- which makes the command free for the user.
  Do **not** invoke `describer.py` (that is the API-based fallback path).

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the repo root and audience level

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into two things: `$LEVEL` (how the descriptions sound) and
`$REPO` (the directory to analyze).

**Level**: if the first token is one of `newbie`, `middle`, `strong`, or
`expert`, consume it as `$LEVEL`. Otherwise, set `$LEVEL=""` — the preservation
step below will adopt the prior run's level, or fall back to `newbie` on a
first run.

**Repo**: the next token (if any) is the path. Otherwise use the current
working directory. Store as `$REPO`.

Examples:
- `/prefxplain` → `$LEVEL=""`, `$REPO=.`
- `/prefxplain expert` → `$LEVEL=expert`, `$REPO=.`
- `/prefxplain newbie /path/to/repo` → `$LEVEL=newbie`, `$REPO=/path/to/repo`
- `/prefxplain /path/to/repo` → `$LEVEL=""`, `$REPO=/path/to/repo`

What each level means (use this for step 4c's voice):
- **newbie** — first-year CS student. Zero jargon. Plain verbs, concrete
  analogies. Explain what an outsider sees happening. *(default when unset)*
- **middle** — working developer. Standard industry terms without
  explanation. Skim-friendly one-liners.
- **strong** — senior engineer. Name patterns (visitor, SCC) without
  explaining them. Call out non-obvious invariants and trade-offs.
- **expert** — domain specialist. Skip introductions. Lead with what is
  unusual or decision-carrying. Precise vocabulary, no padding.

### 2. Analyze and save JSON (preserving previous descriptions)

The `LEVEL` env var carries `$LEVEL` from step 1 into the python script. If it
matches the prior run's level (or if either side is empty), descriptions are
preserved. Otherwise, all descriptions/titles/flowcharts/highlights are cleared
so step 4c re-writes them in the new voice.

```bash
cd $REPO && LEVEL="$LEVEL" python -c "
import os
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.analyzer import analyze
from prefxplain.graph import Graph

root = Path('.')
graph = analyze(root, max_files=500)

requested_level = (os.environ.get('LEVEL') or '').strip().lower()
valid_levels = {'newbie', 'middle', 'strong', 'expert'}
if requested_level and requested_level not in valid_levels:
    requested_level = ''

# Preserve descriptions, titles, flowcharts, groups, and highlights from previous run
prev = root / 'prefxplain.json'
prior_level = ''
if prev.exists():
    old = Graph.load(prev)
    prior_level = (getattr(old.metadata, 'level', '') or '').strip().lower()
    level_changed = bool(requested_level and prior_level and requested_level != prior_level)
    effective_level = requested_level or prior_level or 'newbie'

    if level_changed:
        # Drop prior descriptions so step 4c re-writes them in the new voice.
        # Keep group assignments — architecture doesn't change with level.
        for node in graph.nodes:
            old_node = {n.id: n for n in old.nodes}.get(node.id)
            if old_node and old_node.group: node.group = old_node.group
        if old.metadata.groups: graph.metadata.groups = old.metadata.groups
        print(f'LEVEL_CHANGED: {prior_level} -> {requested_level}')
    else:
        old_map = {n.id: n for n in old.nodes}
        for node in graph.nodes:
            old_node = old_map.get(node.id)
            if old_node:
                if old_node.description: node.description = old_node.description
                if old_node.short_title: node.short_title = old_node.short_title
                if old_node.flowchart: node.flowchart = old_node.flowchart
                if old_node.group: node.group = old_node.group
                if old_node.highlights: node.highlights = list(old_node.highlights)
        # Preserve summary/health/groups/group_highlights if they exist
        if old.metadata.summary: graph.metadata.summary = old.metadata.summary
        if old.metadata.health_score: graph.metadata.health_score = old.metadata.health_score
        if old.metadata.health_notes: graph.metadata.health_notes = old.metadata.health_notes
        if old.metadata.groups: graph.metadata.groups = old.metadata.groups
        if old.metadata.group_highlights: graph.metadata.group_highlights = dict(old.metadata.group_highlights)
else:
    effective_level = requested_level or 'newbie'

graph.metadata.level = effective_level

graph.save(root / 'prefxplain.json')
described = sum(1 for n in graph.nodes if n.description)
print(f'FILES: {len(graph.nodes)}')
print(f'EDGES: {len(graph.edges)}')
print(f'LANGUAGES: {graph.metadata.languages}')
print(f'DESCRIBED: {described}/{len(graph.nodes)}')
print(f'TRUNCATED: {len(graph.nodes) >= 500}')
print(f'LEVEL: {effective_level}')
"
```

Read the output. **If TRUNCATED is True**, stop and ask:

> I found N files and hit the 500-file cap. Want me to scope to a subdirectory
> (e.g. `src/`) or proceed on the truncated set?

Do not silently drop files.

**If DESCRIBED equals FILES** and `--force` was NOT passed, skip to step 4e
(just refresh the summary/health and re-render — all descriptions are current).

### 3. If `--no-descriptions` was passed, skip to step 5.

### 4. Fill in groups and descriptions

#### 4a. Define architectural groups

Before describing individual files, look at the file list and define 2-5
**architectural groups** that reflect how the codebase is actually organized.
These become the top-level blocks in the diagram.

Rules:
- Groups should reflect logical architecture, NOT directory structure.
  BAD: "prefxplain/", "tests/" (that's just folders)
  GOOD: "Analysis Pipeline", "Visualization Engine", "CLI & Exports"
- Group names MUST be self-explanatory. A reader who has never seen the codebase
  should understand what kind of files are inside just from the group name alone.
  BAD: "Integration & Tooling" (tooling for what? integration with what?)
  BAD: "Utilities", "Helpers", "Core", "Miscellaneous" (says nothing)
  GOOD: "CLI & Exports" (clear: the command-line interface and format exporters)
  GOOD: "Code Analysis" (clear: the part that analyzes code)
  GOOD: "Graph Visualization" (clear: the part that draws the graph)
  If you can't name a group clearly, it probably contains files that belong in
  different groups — split it up.
- Each group needs a short description (1 sentence) that appears on hover.
- Test files go in a "Tests" group — it will be visually de-emphasized.
- Every file must belong to exactly one group.
- Think: if you were drawing this on a whiteboard for a new teammate, what
  would the 2-4 big boxes be? Would the labels make sense without explanation?

Patch the groups into the JSON:

```bash
cd $REPO && python3 << 'PYEOF'
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.graph import Graph

graph = Graph.load(Path("prefxplain.json"))

# FILL THESE IN — group name → one-sentence description
graph.metadata.groups = {
    # "Analysis Pipeline": "Scans source files, parses imports, and builds the dependency graph.",
    # "Visualization Engine": "Renders the interactive HTML diagram with layout, clustering, and flowcharts.",
    # "Tests": "Automated test coverage for all modules.",
}

# FILL THESE IN — assign each file to a group
file_groups = {
    # "src/analyzer.py": "Analysis Pipeline",
    # "src/renderer.py": "Visualization Engine",
    # "tests/test_analyzer.py": "Tests",
}

for node in graph.nodes:
    if node.id in file_groups:
        node.group = file_groups[node.id]

graph.save(Path("prefxplain.json"))
print(f"Defined {len(graph.metadata.groups)} groups, assigned {len(file_groups)} files")
PYEOF
```

IMPORTANT: You MUST fill in both dicts with real values. Every file must be
assigned to a group. Group names should be human-readable, 1-3 words.

#### 4b. List undescribed nodes

```bash
cd $REPO && python -c "
import json
g = json.loads(open('prefxplain.json').read())
for n in g['nodes']:
    if not n.get('description'):
        print(n['id'])
" 
```

If the list is empty, skip to step 4e.

#### 4c. Read files and write descriptions in batches

Process 10-20 files per batch. For each file:

**How much to read:**
- **Short files (<80 lines)**: read the whole thing.
- **Barrel/index files** (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `index.js`): read the whole
  thing -- the re-exports are the content.
- **Default (80-500 lines)**: imports block + top-level definitions + module
  docstring. Usually the first 60-120 lines.
- **Huge files (>500 lines)**: first 150 lines, then grep for `^class `, `^def `,
  `^export `, `^function ` to get the shape.

**Voice for `$LEVEL`** — apply this tone to `short_title`, `description`, and
the flowchart `label` / `description` fields below:

- **newbie** (default): first-year CS student. Zero jargon. Every term glossed in plain
  words ("a cache is a box that remembers recent results"). Concrete analogies.
  Everyday verbs ("picks", "asks", "saves") instead of technical ones ("invokes",
  "resolves", "persists"). Describe what an outsider sees happening.
- **middle**: working developer familiar with REST/MVC/caching/ORM/CI.
  Standard industry terms used without explanation. Skim-friendly one-liners.
- **strong**: senior engineer. Name the pattern (visitor, circuit breaker, SCC)
  without explaining it. Call out non-obvious invariants, constraints, and
  trade-offs instead of restating the obvious.
- **expert**: domain specialist. Lead with what is unusual or decision-carrying
  (which algorithm variant, which API boundary, which trade-off). Precise
  technical vocabulary, no padding, no introductions.

**For each file, generate FOUR things:**

1. **`short_title`** (2-5 words, informative phrase): The file's role rendered
   as the **primary label** on the diagram card — the filename is demoted to
   a small mono subtitle underneath. Because the title owns the visual primacy,
   it must describe what the file DOES in words the audience (`$LEVEL`)
   actually recognises. Not a 1-word tag, not an abbreviation.

   Hard rules:
   - Do NOT use the filename or a slug of it (`graph.py` → BAD, `utils` → BAD).
   - Do NOT use bare abbreviations at newbie/middle level (`AR Predictor` →
     BAD; `Autoregressive Predictor` → GOOD).
   - Think "sticky note on a whiteboard": 2-5 words that land even without
     any bullets underneath.

   Examples:
   - GOOD: `Dependency Graph Builder`, `JWT Request Validator`, `HTML Diagram Renderer`, `Flowchart Popup UI`
   - GOOD for tests: `Graph Module Tests`, `CLI End-to-End Tests`
   - BAD: `Graph`, `Renderer`, `Utils`, `Core`, `graph.py`

2. **`description`** (1-2 sentences): What the file exposes and who uses it.
   Start with an active verb. Be specific enough that a reader who knows the
   domain could guess the file's role without opening it. Voice matches `$LEVEL`.

   Hard rules:
   - Don't start with "This file", "Contains", "Module for", "Handles".
   - Don't repeat the filename.
   - Don't hedge ("some", "various", "utilities for"). If it's truly a grab-bag,
     name the 2-3 main things.
   - Present tense, active voice.

   Examples (middle-level voice):
   - GOOD: `Validates JWT tokens; exposes verify(token) which returns the decoded payload or raises AuthError.`
   - GOOD: `Builds the dependency graph via AST walking; main entry point for analyze() and Graph.from_root().`
   - BAD: `This file handles authentication logic for the app.` (starts with "This file", vague)
   - BAD: `Utilities for processing graph data and various helpers.` (hedged, grab-bag)

   Test files: describe what behavior is covered, not the framework.
   `Covers edge cases in Graph.add_edge, including self-referential cycles and missing imports.`

3. **`highlights`** (list of **exactly 3 strings**): CONCRETE, codebase-specific
   facts about this file. These render as bullet points **on the diagram card
   itself**, so they are the second-chance summary: if the title + 3 bullets
   don't let a reader understand what the block does, the card has failed.

   Self-test before you save: *"If I only ever saw this card's title and 3
   bullets — no description, no code — would I understand this file's role in
   the project?"* If the answer is no, rewrite the bullets.

   Style:
   - Always exactly 3 bullets. No `[]`. No 1-bullet. No 2-bullet.
     If you're tempted to write fewer, you haven't looked hard enough: pick
     one behaviour, one input/output, and one dependency or constraint.
   - Each bullet **must be ≤48 characters** (fits the card without wrapping).
     Aim for 25-40 so the eye can scan.
   - **Self-explanatory at the target `$LEVEL`.** Spell out acronyms and
     domain jargon unless the audience would say them out loud. At newbie
     level: write `Autoregressive next-step prediction`, NOT `AR next-step
     pred`. At expert level `AR` is fine.
   - Mix across these three slots:
     1. a behaviour the file performs ("Caches descriptions in SQLite")
     2. a concrete input/output ("Emits prefxplain.json", "Reads *.py imports")
     3. a dependency, constraint, or named integration ("Uses Claude Code",
        "PyTorch 2.3", "Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
   - Fragments, not sentences — no trailing period. Leading capital OK.

   Examples (newbie voice):
   - GOOD: `["Picks out every import in a Python file", "Writes a JSON graph to disk", "Uses Python's built-in AST parser"]`
   - GOOD: `["Listens on port 8765", "Streams prefxplain.html changes live", "Talks to the VS Code preview tab"]`
   - BAD: `["AR next-step pred", "ViT encoder", "SIGReg"]`
     (abbreviations — a newbie cannot read this)
   - BAD: `["handles user commands", "well-structured", "entry point"]`
     (generic, no proper nouns or concrete facts)
   - BAD: `["uses a SQLite database for caching descriptions across runs"]`
     (too long, one instead of three)

4. **`flowchart`** (dict): A flowchart showing the ACTUAL logic flow of the file.
   This is what appears when a user double-clicks a block in the diagram.
   It MUST reflect the real behavior of the code, NOT be generic.

   Structure: `{"nodes": [...], "edges": [...]}`
   - Each node: `{"id": "1", "label": "3-6 words", "type": "start|end|decision|step",
     "description": "1 concrete sentence — hover tooltip"}`
   - Each edge: `{"from": "1", "to": "2", "label": "condition or empty string"}`

   Rules:
   - Use 3-7 nodes. One "start" node, one "end" node.
   - Decision nodes MUST have 2+ outgoing edges with meaningful condition labels
     (e.g. "yes"/"no", "found"/"not found", "valid"/"invalid", "Python"/"JS/TS").
   - Labels should describe what happens, not name functions
     (GOOD: "Parse import statements", BAD: "_analyze_python()")
   - **description** is the most important field — it's what appears on hover.
     Write it like you're explaining to a smart friend who doesn't know this
     codebase. Short, plain language, no jargon. One sentence max.
     BAD: "Calls ast.parse() on the file content, then walks the module body
     to extract ImportFrom and FunctionDef nodes." (too technical)
     BAD: "Processes the input data." (too vague)
     GOOD: "Reads the Python file and picks out every function, class, and
     import it finds."

   Example for an auth middleware:
   ```json
   {"nodes": [
     {"id": "1", "label": "Receive HTTP request", "type": "start",
      "description": "Every incoming request passes through here before reaching your route handlers."},
     {"id": "2", "label": "Authorization header present?", "type": "decision",
      "description": "Looks for a 'Bearer xxx' token in the request headers. No token means no entry."},
     {"id": "3", "label": "Validate JWT token", "type": "step",
      "description": "Checks that the token hasn't expired and was actually signed by your server."},
     {"id": "4", "label": "Return 401 Unauthorized", "type": "step",
      "description": "Blocks the request with a 401 error — the user needs to log in again."},
     {"id": "5", "label": "Token valid?", "type": "decision",
      "description": "If the token is expired or tampered with, the request gets rejected."},
     {"id": "6", "label": "Attach user to request", "type": "step",
      "description": "Saves the user's identity on the request so your route handlers know who's calling."},
     {"id": "7", "label": "Pass to next handler", "type": "end",
      "description": "The request continues to your actual route handler with the user info attached."}
   ], "edges": [
     {"from": "1", "to": "2", "label": ""},
     {"from": "2", "to": "3", "label": "yes"},
     {"from": "2", "to": "4", "label": "no"},
     {"from": "3", "to": "5", "label": ""},
     {"from": "5", "to": "6", "label": "valid"},
     {"from": "5", "to": "4", "label": "expired"},
     {"from": "6", "to": "7", "label": ""},
     {"from": "4", "to": "7", "label": ""}
   ]}
   ```

#### 4d. Patch the JSON after each batch

After writing descriptions for a batch, run this script with the dict filled in:

```bash
cd $REPO && python3 << 'PYEOF'
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.graph import Graph

graph = Graph.load(Path("prefxplain.json"))

# FILL THIS IN -- one entry per file in this batch
# Format: "path/to/file.py": ("Short Title", "Full description.", [highlights], {flowchart_dict}),
files = {
    # "src/auth.py": ("JWT Validator", "Validates JWT tokens; exposes verify(token).", ["PyJWT", "HS256", "15 min TTL"], {"nodes": [...], "edges": [...]}),
}

for node in graph.nodes:
    if node.id in files:
        entry = files[node.id]
        node.short_title = entry[0]
        node.description = entry[1]
        if len(entry) > 2 and entry[2]:
            node.highlights = list(entry[2])
        if len(entry) > 3 and entry[3]:
            node.flowchart = entry[3]

graph.save(Path("prefxplain.json"))
print(f"Patched {len(files)} files")
PYEOF
```

IMPORTANT: You MUST fill in the `files` dict with real values before running.
Each value is a 4-tuple: `("Short Title", "Full description.", [highlights], {flowchart})`.
The flowchart dict is required — it MUST reflect the actual logic of the file.
Highlights MUST be a list of exactly 3 strings — see step 4c rule 3 for the
self-test ("would a reader understand this block from title + 3 bullets?").
Do NOT leave the placeholder comment. Run once per batch. Save after each batch.

#### 4e. Completeness check

After all batches, verify nothing was missed:

```bash
cd $REPO && python -c "
import json
g = json.loads(open('prefxplain.json').read())
missing = [n['id'] for n in g['nodes'] if not n.get('description')]
print(f'MISSING: {len(missing)}')
for f in missing: print(f'  {f}')
"
```

If MISSING > 0, go back and describe them.

#### 4f. Generate group-level highlights

After file-level highlights are in place, synthesize up to 3 group-level
bullets per architectural group — concrete facts that span multiple files
within the group (e.g. "supports Claude Code + Codex + Copilot" from three
sibling integration files, not from any single one). These render on the
group's card in the diagram.

Style (same constraints as file highlights):
- Each bullet ≤35 characters, fragment not sentence, proper nouns only.
- Voice matches `$LEVEL`.
- Empty list `[]` when nothing cross-file stands out. Don't pad.

```bash
cd $REPO && python3 << 'PYEOF'
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.graph import Graph

graph = Graph.load(Path("prefxplain.json"))

# FILL THESE IN — group name → list of up to 3 concrete, cross-file facts
graph.metadata.group_highlights = {
    # "CLI & Integrations": ["Claude Code + Codex + Copilot", "Typer CLI", "MCP stdio server"],
    # "Code Analysis": ["7 languages", "Claude Sonnet 4.6", "SQLite cache"],
}

graph.save(Path("prefxplain.json"))
print(f"Patched {len(graph.metadata.group_highlights)} group highlights")
PYEOF
```

Skip groups where nothing concrete spans the files. Empty list is fine.

#### 4g. Generate executive summary + health score

This is the most important step. The summary is what founders paste into decks
and what devs read to understand a project in 30 seconds.

First, collect the structural signals you need. Run:

```bash
cd $REPO && python -c "
import json
from collections import Counter
g = json.loads(open('prefxplain.json').read())
indeg = Counter()
outdeg = Counter()
for e in g['edges']:
    indeg[e['target']] += 1
    outdeg[e['source']] += 1
print('FILES:', len(g['nodes']))
print('EDGES:', len(g['edges']))
print('LANGUAGES:', g['metadata']['languages'])
# Top 3 most-imported
for f, c in indeg.most_common(3):
    desc = next((n.get('description','') for n in g['nodes'] if n['id']==f), '')
    print(f'HUB: {f} ({c} imports) -- {desc}')
# Entry points
for n in g['nodes']:
    if indeg[n['id']] == 0 and not n['id'].startswith('tests/'):
        print(f'ENTRY: {n[\"id\"]}')
# Orphans
orphans = [n['id'] for n in g['nodes'] if indeg[n['id']]==0 and outdeg[n['id']]==0]
print(f'ORPHANS: {len(orphans)}')
# Cycles
cycles = g.get('cycle_node_ids', [])
print(f'CYCLES: {len(cycles)} nodes in cycles')
# Test ratio
tests = sum(1 for n in g['nodes'] if n['id'].startswith('tests/'))
print(f'TEST_RATIO: {tests}/{len(g[\"nodes\"])}')
"
```

Now look at the README too if it exists. Use the Read tool on `$REPO/README.md`
(first 30 lines). This gives you the project's own description of itself.

**Then write the summary and health score.** This is NOT an aggregation of the
per-file descriptions. It answers a different question: "What is this project,
how is it built, and should I be worried about the architecture?"

Use these structural signals + the README + your understanding from reading the
files to write:

- **summary**: 3-5 sentences. What does the project do? What are the main
  architectural layers? What's the critical path (entry -> core)? Mention
  specific file names for the load-bearing modules. A non-technical person
  should understand the first sentence; a dev should find the next 2-3 useful.

- **health_score**: integer 1-10. Based on: cycles (>0 = -2), orphan ratio
  (>20% = -1), test coverage (no tests = -3, <50% ratio = -1), single points
  of failure (one file with >50% of imports = -1), overall modularity.

- **health_notes**: 1-2 sentences interpreting the score. Name the specific
  risks. "No circular dependencies. graph.py is a single point of failure
  (13 of 17 files depend on it). Test coverage is solid (9 test files for
  8 source files)."

Patch them into the JSON:

```bash
cd $REPO && python3 << 'PYEOF'
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.graph import Graph

graph = Graph.load(Path("prefxplain.json"))

# FILL THESE IN from your analysis above
graph.metadata.summary = "..."
graph.metadata.health_score = 8
graph.metadata.health_notes = "..."

graph.save(Path("prefxplain.json"))
print("Patched summary + health")
PYEOF
```

IMPORTANT: The summary must NOT be generic. It must name specific files, specific
numbers, and specific architectural decisions. If it reads like it could describe
any project, rewrite it.

### 5. Render the final HTML

```bash
cd $REPO && python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from prefxplain.graph import Graph
from prefxplain.renderer import render

graph = Graph.load(Path('prefxplain.json'))
output = Path('${OUTPUT:-prefxplain.html}')
render(graph, output_path=output)
print(f'Written: {output}')
print(f'OPEN: {output.resolve()}')
"
```

If `--output` was passed in `$ARGUMENTS`, use that path instead of the default.

### 6. Preview in IDE

Open the generated HTML in the installed PrefXplain IDE preview:

```bash
HTML_ABS="$REPO/prefxplain.html"
[ -f "$HTML_ABS" ] || HTML_ABS="$(python3 -c 'import pathlib,sys; print(pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]).resolve())' "$REPO/prefxplain.html")"
IDE_SCHEME="$(python3 -c "
import os
term = (os.environ.get('TERM_PROGRAM') or '').lower().strip()
generic = {'', 'apple_terminal', 'iterm.app', 'hyper', 'tmux', 'rxvt', 'xterm', 'xterm-256color', 'alacritty', 'kitty', 'ghostty', 'warp', 'wezterm'}
print('vscode' if term in generic else term)
")"
PREVIEW_URI="$(HTML_ABS="$HTML_ABS" IDE_SCHEME="$IDE_SCHEME" python3 -c "import os, urllib.parse; print(f\"{os.environ['IDE_SCHEME']}://prefxplain.prefxplain-vscode/preview?path={urllib.parse.quote(os.environ['HTML_ABS'])}\")")"

case "$(uname -s 2>/dev/null)" in
  Darwin*)
    command -v open >/dev/null 2>&1 && open "$PREVIEW_URI" 2>/dev/null || true
    ;;
  Linux*)
    if [ -n "${DISPLAY:-}${WAYLAND_DISPLAY:-}" ] && command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      xdg-open "$PREVIEW_URI" 2>/dev/null || true
    elif command -v wslview >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      wslview "$PREVIEW_URI" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
    ;;
  MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*)
    command -v start >/dev/null 2>&1 && start "" "$PREVIEW_URI" 2>/dev/null || true
    ;;
esac
```

Then report the path:

```bash
printf '\n\033]8;;%s\033\\%s\033]8;;\033\\\n' \
  "$PREVIEW_URI" "▶ Open preview in IDE (Cmd/Ctrl+click here)"
echo ""
echo "URI:          $PREVIEW_URI"
echo "HTML on disk: $HTML_ABS"
echo "Fallback:     Cmd+Shift+P → PrefXplain: Preview diagram"
```

Do not start a localhost server by default. The plugin webview is the primary preview path.

### 7. Report to the user

Keep this tight. Pull structural insights from the JSON:

- **File count + languages** (note if the cap was hit)
- **Top 3 most-imported files** -- the load-bearing abstractions. Name them with
  their one-line description.
- **Entry points** (in-degree 0, excluding tests) -- where to start reading
- **Orphans** (no imports in or out) -- if >3, give the count, offer to list
- **Cycles** if detected -- flag as architectural debt
- **Preview — MUST be rendered as a Markdown link**, not as a bare URL, because
  Codex / Claude Code / Copilot / Gemini panes make Markdown links reliably
  Cmd/Ctrl-clickable. Format exactly like this:

  ```
  Preview: [▶ Open in IDE]($PREVIEW_URI) ([fallback]: `prefxplain.html` at $HTML_ABS, or `Cmd+Shift+P → PrefXplain: Preview diagram`)
  ```

Close with: "Happy to walk through any specific file or cluster."
Don't preempt -- wait for the user to ask.

## Notes

- The HTML is self-contained, works offline, safe to share with non-technical
  stakeholders
- `prefxplain.json` stays on disk so re-running `/prefxplain` only describes
  new or changed files — previous descriptions are preserved automatically
- The HTML renderer already surfaces entry points, core files, orphans, and cycles
  visually -- the text report is a summary for people reading along in chat
- The IDE extension preview is the default viewing path. Use a localhost server only
  if the user explicitly asks for browser preview.

### View modes

The new default renderer is **ELK-based** (SVG, layered top→bottom, orthogonal
edge routing). It ships two user-selectable views via the switcher in the top bar:

- **Group map** (default): one hero card per architectural group. Inter-group
  arrows are aggregated with a `Nx imports` label. Best for the 30-second
  "what does this codebase do" view.
- **Nested**: groups become containers and files appear inside as mini-dashboard
  cards (role glyph + name + size dots + 2 highlights + IN/OUT fan bars).
  File-level arrows are routed orthogonally; fan-in hubs like a SPOF get a
  visual bus trunk rather than a 15-arrow comb.

Keyboard: `/` focuses the filter, `Escape` deselects, double-click on a file
card opens a 3-column Flow modal (importers → file → dependencies).

If you need the older Canvas-based layout for any reason (e.g. parity with
pre-redesign screenshots), pass `--renderer=legacy`. The old path is kept for
a transition period and will be removed in a follow-up PR.
