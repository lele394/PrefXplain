_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2_TEMPLATE = """\
You write block descriptions for an interactive codebase architecture diagram.
Audience voice: __VOICE__
Given a source file, output JSON describing it.
Rules:
- "file": 1-2 sentences. Start with a verb (e.g. "Handles...", "Reads...", "Manages..."). Do not mention the filename.
- "symbols": for each symbol name, write 3-6 words saying what it does \
(e.g. "run": "starts the web server", "User": "stores user account data"). \
Only include functions and classes, not imports or variables.
- "highlights": aim for exactly 3 CONCRETE, codebase-specific facts that make this file \
interesting. Proper nouns: named integrations, third-party tools, model names, \
hyperparameters, cloud providers, protocols, file formats, CLI tools, exact thresholds. \
NOT adjectives or architectural platitudes. Keep each bullet under 40 chars — these \
render on the diagram card itself, so a reader should grok them at a glance. \
GOOD: ["Claude Code integration", "Codex CLI support", "SQLite cache"]. \
BAD: ["handles user commands", "entry point for CLI", "well-structured module"]. \
Return [] only if truly nothing concrete stands out. Empty is better than generic.
- "semantic_role": EXACTLY one of these keywords: "hub" (many files depend on this), \
"gateway" (external entry — CLI/HTTP/API boundary), "pipeline" (orchestrates a sequence \
of steps), "adapter" (wraps/translates an external service), "sink" (terminal — writes \
outputs, no consumers), "standalone" (isolated utility). Pick the single best fit, or \
"" if none apply.
- "flow": ONE short sentence, max ~15 words, of the form "receives X from Y, produces Z \
for W" or "reads X, emits Y on Z". Describe the DATA flow as an outsider would observe \
it. Skip if the file is pure configuration. Empty string "" is better than generic.
- "extends_at": ONE sentence naming the concrete extension point for someone adding a \
feature here (e.g. "register a new rule type in RULE_HANDLERS", "add a subclass of \
Exporter", "add a key to _LEVEL_VOICES"). Empty string "" if not extendable.
- "pattern": EXACTLY one keyword if obvious: "registry", "pipeline", "state-machine", \
"visitor", "factory", "strategy", "singleton", "decorator". "" otherwise. One word, \
lowercase.
- "flowchart": a flowchart showing the main logic of the file. \
Use 3-7 nodes. Each node has "id" (string "1","2"...), "label" (3-6 words describing the step), \
"type" ("start", "end", "decision", or "step"), and "description" (1 concrete sentence \
explaining what happens here). \
Each edge has "from" and "to" (node ids) and "label" (condition text for decisions, or "" for unconditional). \
The flowchart should reflect the ACTUAL logic flow, not be generic. \
Decision nodes MUST have at least 2 outgoing edges with meaningful condition labels (e.g. "yes"/"no", "found"/"not found", "valid"/"invalid"). \
Start with one "start" node and end with one "end" node.
Respond with valid JSON only, no markdown fences.
Example: {"file": "Manages database connections.", "symbols": {"connect": "opens a database connection"}, \
"highlights": ["PostgreSQL driver", "pgbouncer pooling", "SSL required"], \
"semantic_role": "adapter", \
"flow": "receives query requests from handlers, returns rows via the pool", \
"extends_at": "add a new dialect by implementing the Driver protocol", \
"pattern": "pool", \
"flowchart": {"nodes": [{"id": "1", "label": "Receive query request", "type": "start", \
"description": "Someone wants to run a database query."}, \
{"id": "2", "label": "Connection pool available?", "type": "decision", \
"description": "Checks if there's already an open connection we can reuse instead of creating a new one."}, \
{"id": "3", "label": "Reuse existing connection", "type": "step", \
"description": "Grabs an idle connection from the pool — faster than opening a new one."}, \
{"id": "4", "label": "Create new connection", "type": "step", \
"description": "Opens a fresh connection to the database since the pool was empty."}, \
{"id": "5", "label": "Return query results", "type": "end", \
"description": "Runs the SQL, sends back the rows, and returns the connection to the pool for reuse."}], \
